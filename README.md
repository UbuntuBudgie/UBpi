# Beta 2 - Ubuntu Budgie Pi4 21.04

Date 1 April 2021

Hi folks,


This is our second beta. It is based on 21.04.

**This image is recommended only for a Pi4B or Pi400 with 4Gb/8Gb RAM.**

Just download and write to a SD Card via Gnome Disks or raspi-imager.

# Budgie ARM Tweak tool

After installation and reboot you will see our budgie-arm-config app.

Do read our [guide](https://sourceforge.net/projects/budgie-remix/files/budgie-raspi/UBPi4.pdf/download) how to use this app

By installing the package budgie-arm-environment on Intel/AMD you will see a Menu Budgie ARM application icon - run this to find your Pi IP address on your network (note the nmap issue below)


# Known issues

 1. the graphics are slightly glitchy under the default fkms. We recommend using the KMS mode for direct access displays and fkms for remote access.
